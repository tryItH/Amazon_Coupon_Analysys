# Amazon-Driver-Coupon-Acceptance-Analysis
Analysis - Will the customer accept the coupon?

This analysis seeks to does data analysis and visualization in order to distingish which customers are more likely to accept a driver coupon vs those that didn't accept it. 

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The data demographic information( such as gender, age, maritalStatus, educatin, etc.), driving scenarios (weather, time of day, passengers, etc.), type of coupon, and whether the coupon was accepted or not. 

The following observations were made:
1. When comparing acceptance rate, coupons for cheap restaurants (less than $20 per person) and Carry out & Take away coupons were the most popular. Coupons for Coffee House and more expensive restaurants ($20 - $50) per person were less popular. Coupons for bars were the least popular.
2. There seems to be a negative correlation between age and acceptance rate, with older age groups less likely to accept the coupon than younger age groups. 
3. For bar coupons, drivers who go to bars more than once a month are more likely to accept bar coupons than drivers who went less than once a month or never. 
4. Drivers who go to cheap restaurants more than 8 times a month and have less than 50K in income also accepted more often bar coupons.
5. As temperature increases, coupon acceptance rate increases.
